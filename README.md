# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

Having done this for several years now, I certainly hope that I can get more than the first 10 days or so done, but we'll see what time permits in this busy holiday season!

I'm going to try and do it in Rust this year, although I keep learning it for Advent of Code, and then forgetting a lot of it.
